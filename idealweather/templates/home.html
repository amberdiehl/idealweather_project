                <h2 class="title">Let&apos;s talk weather</h2>
                <p>This site has historical weather data for the year 2017 summarized on a monthly basis. The data source is NOAA,
    and thus is limited to their "stations" which are located at airports through the United States and its
    territories.</p>
                <p>The data includes humidity readings which are generally recorded on an hourly basis. With well over 2,000
    weather stations, the hourly humidity data sets are very large--too large to reasonably query in detail based
    on a user request. So they have been reduced into the monthly station data based on the following categorization
    strategy.</p>
                <p>According to many sources, most people are comfortable when the relative humidity is 40 to 60 percent. That
    is the basis for the categories created to summarize relative humidity:
    </p>
                <ul>
    <li>Less than or equal to 20% (represented as LE20)</li>
    <li>Less than 40% (represented as LT40)</li>
    <li>40% to 60% (represented as 40 to 60 or target)</li>
    <li>Greater than 60% (represented as GT60)</li>
    <li>Greater than or equal to 80% (represented as GE80)</li>
    </ul>
                <p>Within each category is a percentage value or the value 'M' to indicate humidity data was missing. The percent
    value is the percentage of the readings for the month that were within that given range. For example, if GE80
    contains 0.56, then 56% of the humidity readings for the month were greater than or equal to 80% relative humidity.</p>
                <p>It is import to note that some stations do not record humidity or have some readings but their frequency
    is far less than hourly. In fact, this issue is true of all the data provided--values may be missing at any
    given time for various data points.</p>
